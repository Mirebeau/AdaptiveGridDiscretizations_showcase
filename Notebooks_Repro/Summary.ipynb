    "The notebooks presented in this volume have two main goals:\n",
    "* Validating the convergence rates of numerical methods, by e.g. comparison with analytical solutions at several discretizatins. Reproducing the corresponding data and figures found in some publications. These results are provided in the spirit of reproducible research, and they may be regarded as companion material for the corresponding papers.\n",
    "* Validating numerical solvers by comparison with alternative approaches. In particular, comparing the GPU eikonal solver with the CPU eikonal solver, in terms of accuracy and computation time. For sufficiently large instance sizes, and depending on the particular application, accelerations by a factor $20 \\times$ to $200 \\times$ can be obtained on suitable GPUs, which may open up new applications involving e.g. realtime interaction. \n",
